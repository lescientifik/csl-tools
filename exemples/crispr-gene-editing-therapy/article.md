# CRISPR-Cas9: Advances in Gene Editing Therapy

## Introduction

CRISPR-Cas9 technology has revolutionized the field of genetic engineering, offering unprecedented precision in modifying DNA sequences. Recent advances have focused on improving delivery systems and reducing off-target effects [@pmid:41524770].

## Delivery Systems

One of the main challenges in CRISPR therapy is the efficient delivery of the Cas9 machinery into target cells. Novel lipid-silica hybrid nanoparticles have shown promising results for therapeutic genome editing, enabling fusogenic association and secured transfection of CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoproteins [@pmid:41524478].

## Precision and Fidelity

Achieving high fidelity in gene editing is crucial for therapeutic applications. Recent work has demonstrated Cas9 variants with superfidelity and broad compatibility, particularly for targeting genes like transthyretin [@pmid:41481737].

## Therapeutic Applications

CRISPR-Cas9 has numerous therapeutic applications across various diseases [@pmid:41476860]. One notable example is the treatment of hemophilia B, where template-jumping editing approaches have shown promise for F9-associated gene therapy [@pmid:41465342].

## Conclusion

The rapid advancement of CRISPR technology continues to open new possibilities for treating genetic disorders. The combination of improved delivery systems, higher fidelity enzymes, and innovative editing strategies positions CRISPR-Cas9 as a cornerstone of future gene therapy.
