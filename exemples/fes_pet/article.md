# 18F-FES PET/CT in Breast Cancer: Current Evidence and Clinical Applications

## Introduction

16α-[18F]fluoro-17β-estradiol (18F-FES) is a radiolabeled estrogen analogue approved by the FDA in 2020 for the detection of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive lesions in patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer [@ryu2024]. This imaging modality enables whole-body, non-invasive assessment of functional ER expression, offering significant advantages over conventional tissue biopsy [@cuzzocrea2025](https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers17101644).

## Diagnostic Performance

### Detection of Metastatic Disease

Multiple recent studies have evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FES PET/CT. Shin et al. demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance for detecting recurrent and metastatic disease [@shin2025], while Knip et al. compared 18F-FES with 18F-FDG PET for staging grade 1-2 ER-positive tumors [@knip2025]. Both studies reported sensitivities approaching 100%.

### Comparison with FDG-PET

The comparison between FES-PET and FDG-PET is particularly relevant for low-grade tumors. As noted by several authors [@hunter2025][@knip2025][@miller2025], FES-PET may outperform FDG-PET in tumors with low metabolic activity but high ER expression.

## Predicting Response to Endocrine Therapy

### Meta-analyses Evidence

Two comprehensive meta-analyses have examined the role of FES-PET in predicting response to endocrine therapy [@specht2026; @parihar2025]. These studies pooled data from multiple centers and confirmed the prognostic value of FES uptake.

### Clinical Decision Making

The impact of FES-PET on clinical decisions was assessed by Ryu et al. [@ryu2024, p. 1691], who found that imaging results modified treatment plans in a significant proportion of patients.

## Guiding Treatment Selection

Recent work from Fudan University [@xie2025](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-025-07459-w) screened over 1600 patients and demonstrated that FES-guided therapy selection improved progression-free survival. This finding was supported by the systematic review from Xu et al. [@xu2025](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13550-025-01205-x).

## Automated Lesion Detection

With the advent of artificial intelligence, Miller et al. [@miller2025] evaluated automated tools for lesion detection on FES-PET images. Their concordance analysis with standard-of-care imaging showed promising results for clinical implementation.

## Comprehensive Reviews

Several umbrella reviews and meta-analyses have synthesized the current evidence [@cuzzocrea2025] [@xu2025] [@parihar2025]. These reviews highlight the growing body of literature supporting FES-PET integration into clinical practice guidelines, including the NCCN recommendations.

## ER Heterogeneity Assessment

One unique advantage of FES-PET is its ability to assess ER heterogeneity across multiple metastatic sites. This was demonstrated in patients with mixed ER expression patterns [@hunter2025](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13058-025-01975-1) [@ryu2024](https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.124.267913).

## Discussion

The evidence from diagnostic studies [@shin2025; @knip2025; @miller2025], prognostic analyses [@specht2026; @parihar2025; @xie2025], and clinical impact assessments [@ryu2024] consistently supports the value of 18F-FES PET/CT in managing ER-positive breast cancer.

Compared to traditional biopsy approaches, FES-PET offers several advantages. First, it enables non-invasive whole-body assessment [@cuzzocrea2025]. Second, it can detect ER heterogeneity that might be missed by single-site biopsy [@hunter2025]. Third, it has demonstrated clinical impact on treatment decisions [@ryu2024].

## Conclusion

18F-FES PET/CT has emerged as a valuable imaging modality for ER-positive breast cancer. The accumulated evidence from multiple studies [@specht2026] [@hunter2025] [@xie2025] [@miller2025] [@cuzzocrea2025] [@shin2025] [@knip2025] [@xu2025] [@ryu2024] [@parihar2025] supports its integration into clinical practice for staging, restaging, and treatment selection.
